Reasons For 100:
    We use a bunch of JS spanning 4 files

    We use JS classes that makes the code readable

    Code can be modified and extend well.
        Can easily make new types of towers and enemies
            Only have to can the defination in one place
        Enemy Path is easy to change to quickly create new levels
            You just have to set a direction and length for a bit of the path and it draws the path and sets the enemies along it.

    Game gets harder as time passes
